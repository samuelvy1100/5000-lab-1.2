# Introduction

Welcome to this Quarto website. The goal is to demonstrate professional formatting using text, lists, images, equations, and diagrams. [^1] [^2]

Roman economic and social structures shaped much of Europeâ€™s development [@garnsey2015roman].  
Later interpretations of decline provide valuable historical lessons [@gibbon2003decline].  

[^1]: This site is a demonstration project created for coursework.
[^2]: Chat-GPT 5 was used to refine this code
